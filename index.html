            <p>Welcome to Gren’s Character Catalogue!</p>
            <p>This is a site I’ve put together to compile all of the different characters I’ve made, whether they be FCs (Fan Characters, for media which already exists) or OCs (Original Characters, which are of my own creation), they will all be added here.</p>
            <p>To navigate the catalogue, select a logo at the top. This will bring down icons for each character that belong to the media they’re for (For example, click on the Googolplex logo to display characters from Googolplex.)</p>
            <p>From there, the character and their info will display. This includes a picture of them,  basics like their name, age, and gender, their likes/dislikes, backstory, powers, etc. etc.</p>
            <p>If you wish to view a different character once you’ve brought one up, simply select another in the list or select a different brand to view its characters.</p>
            <p>Thank you for perusing Gren’s Character Catalogue!</p>
            <p><span>*Please note that the Catalogue is still being worked on!</span></p>
